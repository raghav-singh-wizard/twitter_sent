### Dataset Improvements :

Improving the dataset is crucial for enhancing the performance and generalization
ability of the machine learning model.
As we know ML is also known as  "Garbage in garbage out" . Here are some ways we could improve the dataet

1. Diversify Data Sources:
 Collect data from various sources to capture a more comprehensive
view of user sentiments and emotions. This helps in reducing biases
that may be present in a single-source dataset.

2. Additional Data Augmentation Techniques:
 Explore and apply additional data augmentation techniques beyond
synonym replacement. Techniques such as back translation,
paraphrasing, and contextual embeddings can provide a richer training
set.

3. Include User Reviews and Feedback:
 Incorporate user reviews and feedback associated with the products.
This qualitative data can offer valuable insights into user experiences
and emotions that may not be explicitly expressed in the given dataset.

4. Contextual Information:
Add contextual information to the dataset, such as the context in which
the product is being used or the user&#39;s demographic information. This
can help the model better understand the nuances of user sentiments.

5. Balanced Sampling:
If possible, ensure balanced sampling within each class to avoid over-
representation or under-representation of certain emotions or
sentiments. This helps prevent biases in the model.

6. Continuous Data Collection:
Establish a system for continuous data collection to keep the dataset
up-to-date with changing user preferences and language trends. I mean (MLOps here)
